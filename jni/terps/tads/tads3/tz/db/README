tads3/tz/db

This directory is in the TADS 3 source code distribution as a placeholder
for the IANA timezone database file.  They're not included in the TADS
distribution, but these public domain files are available from the IANA
site at

   http://www.iana.org/time-zones

Download the zoneinfo database files and gunzip/untar them into this
directory.  You can then run the TADS timezone compiler, tz.t, which
should be in this directory's parent folder.  Run these commands in
that parent folder to build the compiler and compile the database:

   t3make -f tz.t3m
   t3run -plain tz db vmtz.cpp

The "t3run tz" command will read the timezone database files from the
db folder and generate the output file vmtz.cpp.  That file can then be
copied into the TADS source tree in the tads3/derived folder to replace
the previous generated version.
