During the 1980s a small British company called Level 9, run by two brothers (Mike and Pete Austin), produced a series of text
adventure games for a variety of computers. These games received considerable critical acclaim and are probably the best text
adventures written for the small cassette based 8 bit computers common in Britain in the 80s.
<p>
Level 9 wrote their games using a custom designed system known as <nobr>"A-Code"</nobr>, which evolved from games on the 8 bit
computers such as the Acorn BBC Model B, the Sinclair Spectrum and the Commodore 64 to the (then new) 16 bit machines such as
the Amiga and the Atari ST.
<p>
From disassembly of Level 9 games there are thought to be four variants of
A-Code, which are detailed below, and all of which are supported by this
interpreter. Thanks go to Paul David Doherty for analysing the games and
producing the table which follows.
