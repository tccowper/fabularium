Introduction
============

GtkLevel9 is the result of adapting GtkMagnetic to the Level 9
interpreter. This turned out to be more work than I had anticipated:
GtkMagnetic was written for GTK+ 2.0, and a lot of things that were
state-of-the-art then are deprecated now. Lots of little things had to
be rewritten.

In all fairness, these newer APIs often turned out to often be easier
than the original ones, or produce better-looking results. Sometimes
both. So whenever I made any such change, I made sure to backport it
to GtkMagnetic.

As with GtkMagnetic, the main competition to my version is Simon
Baldwin's Glk version. When I began the work on my GTK+ version, his
version did not yet support graphics. I mentioned this in my README
file, which of course was like waving a red rag to a bull. It was only
a few days later that I received an email informing me that the latest
Glk version did support graphics.

Not that this came as any surprise to me. When GtkMagnetic first
appeared, GlkMagnetic didn't support graphics either, and now it even
supports animations. The moral of this story is clear: Never get
involved in a land war in Asia, and never go against a Baldwin when
graphics is on the line.

My highly biased opinion is, of course, that GtkLevel9 is much nicer
to use, mostly thanks to the hard work of the GTK+ developers, but I
suggest you try both and form your own opinion. Feature-wise I guess
they're about equal, give or take a few minor things.

Compiling
=========

Compiling under Unix should be pretty straightforward, though it will
probably require some Makefile editing:

   LEVEL9 should point to the Generic directory of the original
   Level 9 source distribution. This is so that the build process
   will be able to find level9.h and level9.c.

It should be noted that GTK+ is available for non-Unix platforms, e.g.
Microsoft Windows. If anyone manages to compile GtkLevel9 for any of
those, I'd be interested to hear if it worked.

Performance considerations
==========================

It shouldn't take a particularly powerful computer to run GtkLevel9.
Handling a text buffer and displaying still images isn't a demanding
task, not even when scaling up the images from their original tiny
size.

However, if you tell GtkLevel9 to animate line drawing, the entire
picture will be redrawn several times per second until the image is
complete. This is quite simple to implement, but not the most
efficient way of doing it. To avoid bogging down the rest of the
program this is done at a very low priority.

If the performance is still unacceptable, here are a few things you
could try.

* Use a cheaper interpolation mode. In particular, stay away from the
  "Hyperbolic" mode. You probably won't be able to tell its results
  from "Bilinear" anyway.

* Set the image scale factor to 1. That way it won't need to
  interpolate the picture at all.

* Increase the animation speed. This tells how much GtkLevel9 should
  draw before updating the image.

Turning up compiler optimizations may help slightly, but probably not
much in this case. Most of the time-consuming stuff probably happens
within the bowels of GdkPixbuf, and that should already be optimized.

A few words on interpolation modes
==================================

GTK+ 2.x uses the gdk-pixbuf library which, to quote from the
documentation, provides the following interpolation modes when scaling
an image:

   GDK_INTERP_NEAREST

   Nearest neighbor sampling; this is the fastest and lowest quality
   mode. Quality is normally unacceptable when scaling down, but may
   be OK when scaling up.

   GDK_INTERP_TILES

   This is an accurate simulation of the PostScript image operator
   without any interpolation enabled. Each pixel is rendered as a tiny
   parallelogram of solid color, the edges of which are implemented
   with antialiasing. It resembles nearest neighbor for enlargement,
   and bilinear for reduction.

   GDK_INTERP_BILINEAR

   Best quality/speed balance; use this mode by default. Bilinear
   interpolation. For enlargement, it is equivalent to point-sampling
   the ideal bilinear-interpolated image. For reduction, it is
   equivalent to laying down small tiles and integrating over the
   coverage area.

   GDK_INTERP_HYPER

   This is the slowest and highest quality reconstruction function. It
   is derived from the hyperbolic filters in Wolberg's "Digital Image
   Warping", and is formally defined as the hyperbolic-filter sampling
   the ideal hyperbolic-filter interpolated image (the filter is
   designed to be idempotent for 1:1 pixel mapping).

In reality it is unlikely that you will ever want to scale down the
images, unless someone ports the interpreter to a hand-held computer,
so "Nearest" and "Tiles" can be considered as equivalent. They will
both provide a sharp, albeit slightly blocky, image when scaling up.

"Bilinear" and "Hyperbolic" will produce a smoother, slightly blurry,
image. I can't tell the difference between the two, so they can
probably be considered equal as well.

I prefer using the "Bilinear" mode, but on slow computers it may be
prudent to use "Nearest" or "Tiles" in games with animated pictures.
Read the section on performance considerations for some further
elaboration on this.

Splash screens
==============

Some Level 9 games show a splash screen while the game is loading. On
today's computers, loading times are much too short for this, so
GtkMagnetic asks the user to press any key instead. The heuristics to
determine when to do this is somewhat experimental, but appears to work.

If no key is pressed, the picture will be removed automatically after
approximately five seconds.

Changing colours
================

It is possible to specify the fore- and background colours of the text
area and the background colour of the picture area.
